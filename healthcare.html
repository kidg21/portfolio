		<h2>Healthcare</h2>
		<h5>
			Home healthcare agencies manage caregivers who provide medical and
			non-medical support to patients in their homes. These agencies must handle
			scheduling, payroll, compliance, and client records. I led the design and
			development of a cloud-based platform to streamline these operations.

				A home healthcare agency's reputation relies heavily on caregiver
				reliability. This project started when the agency needed better ways to
				track and verify time spent with clients. The solution began as a
				straightforward digital timecard system for improved accountability.
			</h6>
			<h6>
				When I was brought on to this project, the scope and feature set had
				scaled beyond the original 'timecard app'. Over the course of a year,
				most of the business's needs had been asked of this simple piece of
				software revealing the need for a solution that could manage the
				operations of a home healthcare business.
			</h6>
			<h6>
				I was asked to lead a redesign that would account for the new
				requirements and optimize workflows and feature sets based on each
				unique role within the organization. The new product would be
				cloud-based, allowing for real-time updates and access between an
				Angular-based operational platform and a Flutter-based caregiver mobile
				app.

		<h3>Business Operations</h3>
		<h5>
			In addition to providing caregivers a means to manage their schedules and
			tasks, an operational platform was needed to streamline communication and
			coordination between caregivers, clients, and administrative staff.
		</h5>
		<h5>
			I designed a platform to manage client needs, caregiver performance,
			scheduling, task tracking, financials and communication across all roles.
		</h5>
		<h5>
			My approach to product design is to first think through information
			architecture and process flows using a prototyping tool. Once the
			structure is clear, I transition to working in a production environment to
			code final layouts, interactions, and component APIs. For this project the
			tools of choice were Figma for prototyping and Angular and Flutter for
			production.

		<h3>Addressing Efficiency</h3>
		<h5>
			Home healthcare agencies must coordinate multiple complex operations and
			respond rapidly to unexpected changes. One frequent challenge involves
			finding immediate coverage when caregivers are unavailable due to illness
			or absence.
		</h5>
		<h5>
			To address this, I designed a flexible scheduling system that allows for
			quick reassignment of caregivers to open shifts. This system scores all
			staff on caregiver availability, skill sets, and client needs to ensure
			the best possible match.

		</div>
		<h5>
			The automated staffing recommendation system eliminated the need for
			manually contacting caregivers and updating schedules for shift changes.
			This improved efficiency and client satisfaction. The streamlined process
			maintains high-quality care, reduces administrative work, and ensures
			reliable caregiver coverage.

		<h3>What I Learned</h3>
		<h5>
			Understanding business needs, managing requirements, and testing and
			iterating on designs were important to the success of this project. These
			tasks are essential, but they were not my primary takeaway.
		</h5>
		<h5>
			I enjoy working as a member of a small team in a startup environment. On
			this project, each team member was a technology veteran with years of
			experience building software efficiently. I appreciated the absence of ego
			and the respect for each person's contributions. There was a strong sense
			of collaboration, trust, and shared purpose. This made the work productive
			and enjoyable.
		</h5>
		<h5>
			Without the optics that sometimes exist in organizations, I could focus on
			the work and its impact on the business and its users. We delivered new
			features quickly, often in hours or days instead of weeks or months.
			Collaboration can be a buzzword, but in this experience, it was real. Each
			person's strengths and experiences helped us create a better product
			together.
