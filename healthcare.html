		<h2>Healthcare</h2>
		<h5>
			Home healthcare agencies manage caregivers who provide medical and
			non-medical support to patients in their homes. These agencies must handle
			scheduling, payroll, compliance, and client records. I led the design and
			development of a cloud-based platform to streamline these operations.

				A home healthcare agency's reputation relies heavily on caregiver
				reliability. This project started when the agency needed better ways to
				track and verify time spent with clients. The solution began as a
				straightforward digital timecard system for improved accountability.
			</h6>
			<h6>
				When I was brought on to this project, the scope and feature set had
				scaled beyond the original 'timecard app'. Over the course of a year,
				most of the business's needs had been asked of this simple piece of
				software revealing the need for a solution that could manage the
				operations of a home healthcare business.
			</h6>
			<h6>
				I was asked to lead a redesign that would account for the new
				requirements and optimize workflows and feature sets based on each
				unique role within the organization. The new product would be
				cloud-based, allowing for real-time updates and access between an
				Angular-based operational platform and a Flutter-based caregiver mobile
				app.

			The original mobile app was redesigned to allow caregivers to see their
			schedule, clock in and out of shifts, request available shifts, see client
			information and assigned tasks, and monitor their invoice and payment

		<h2>Business Operations</h2>
		<h5>
			In addition to providing caregivers a means to manage their schedules and
			tasks, an operational platform was needed to streamline communication and
			coordination between caregivers, clients, and administrative staff.
		</h5>
		<h5>
			I designed a platform to manage client needs, caregiver performance,
			scheduling, task tracking, financials and communication across all roles.
		</h5>
		<h5>
			My approach to product design is to transition between thinking through
			information architecture and process flows in a prototyping tool and
			working in a production environment to code final layouts, interactions,
			and component APIs. For this project the tools of choice were Figma for
			prototyping and Angular and Flutter for production.

		<h2>Addressing Efficiency</h2>
		<h5>
			Home healthcare agencies must coordinate multiple complex operations and
			respond rapidly to unexpected changes. One frequent challenge involves
			finding immediate coverage when caregivers are unavailable due to illness
			or absence.
		</h5>
		<h5>
			To address this, I designed a flexible scheduling system that allows for
			quick reassignment of caregivers to open shifts. This system scores all
			staff on caregiver availability, skill sets, and client needs to ensure
			the best possible match. The platform also includes real-time
			notifications to alert caregivers of new assignments and changes to their
			schedules.

			<h6 class="is-centered"> Workflow Shift Replacement (Figma) </h6>
		</div>
		<h5>
			The automated scheduling system eliminated manual coordination of shift
			changes, improving efficiency and client satisfaction. This streamlined
			process maintains high-quality care while reducing administrative work and
			ensuring reliable caregiver coverage.

		<h3>What I Learned</h3>
		<h5>
			While understanding business needs, managing requirements, testing and
			iterating on designs were important to the success of this project, those
			are essentially a given and were not my primary takeaway.
		</h5>
		<h5>
			Working as a member of a small team in a startup environment is kind of my
			jam. However, on this project, each team member was a technology veteran
			possessing years of experience in building software efficiently. I was
			grateful for the absence of ego and the respect for each person's
			contributions. There was always a sense of collaboration, trust, and
			shared purpose that made the work not only productive but also enjoyable.
		</h5>
		<h5>
			Without the optics that are sometimes at play in larger organizations, I
			was able to focus on the work itself and the impact it had on our users.
			Instead of taking weeks or months to get new features in the hands of our
			users, we were able to iterate quickly and deliver value in a matter of
			hours or days. Collaboration is a term that can be very buzzy without
			having really meaning. Thankfully, in this experience, each person's
			strengths and experiences were leveraged to create a better product
			together.
