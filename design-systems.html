		<h2>Design Systems</h2>
		<h5>
			Designing enterprise products at scale requires organization, efficiency,
			and predictability. I created a design system to provide guidance and
			establish design principles to our product and development teams.

		<h3>FLAN Design System</h3>
		<h5>
			FLAN is LightBox's Design Language System for products and experiences.
			With the LightBox Design Language as its foundation, the system consists
			of working code, design tools, resources, and human interface guidelines.

				FLAN started in February of 2018 as a front-end platform for the next
				generation of Digital Map Products' application suite. We altered course
				during the summer of 2018 when DMP was acquired by LightBox and the
				focus shifted to creating a design system that could be used across the
				entire organization.

				FLAN includes application theming capabilities, responsive flex layout,
				and components designed for accessibility. Based off the principles of
				atomic design, FLAN provides the basic building blocks of a User
				Interface. Our Component System is organized into atoms, blocks,
				elements, layouts, and templates. Additionally, this system showcases
				our Design Guidelines, Colors, and Icon Library.

		<h3>Integrating UI into the Build Process</h3>
		<h5>
			Managing output files becomes impossible to maintain as products scale. My
			goal was to integrate our UI into the application build process so that
			our components could be maintained at a single source. UI development
			would follow standard development processes and take advantage of
			version-controlled code repositories following a Git workflow. Peer code
			reviews along with manual and automated testing of source code would help
			product teams gain familiarity and confidence with the system while
			squashing bugs and uncovering edge cases.
		</h5>
		<h5>
			I wrote up a strategy which led to my current approach to UI architecture
			and build processes

		<h3>Building the Design System</h3>
		<h5>
			This FLAN design system started with myself and a front-end developer
			researching and testing available tooling for use in building the system.
			We settled on React for our view library, Styled Components was chosen as
			the CSS-in-JS solution, and Storybook was used for component development
			and documentation.
		</h5>

			alt="FLAN Categories Screenshot"
			class="lightbox-trigger"
		/>
		<h5>
			We built the design system in React instead of design tools like Figma
			because we needed a working front-end system quickly for Digital Map
			Products' mobile platform. After LightBox acquired us, this work led
			directly to its use as the base of the company's initial product release.
		</h5>
		<h5>
			I'm now translating the production component library into Figma. Moving
			the 'source of truth' into a prototyping environment enables design work
			without technical overhead or dependencies. This workflow establishes
			clear processes for component requirements, reviews, and versioning.
			Development teams can then track system changes and maintain synchronized
			presentational front-ends across any view library or framework.
		</h5>

	<section class="project-section">
		<h3>Components</h3>
		<h5 style="page-break-after: always">
			All UI components were written as functional React components making use
			of React Hooks. The API was designed to export a standard set of semantic
			properties (React props) for predictability across the library. The intent
			of the system was to allow for all component variations to be achieved
			through configuration alone. Customization was possible but discouraged,
			as it can lead to inconsistencies and increased maintenance overhead.
			Custom components, unless a case was made for their inclusion, would need
			to be maintained outside of the design system.
		</h5>
		<h5 style="padding-top: var(--space-xxl)">
			Using Storybook as a development environment allowed us to build and test
			each component in isolation. We could ensure that every component was
			semantically correct and adaptive across viewports, browsers, and
			operating systems. Accessibility standards (ARIA and WCAG) could be tested
			for compliance. Component states could be tested to ensure correct
			hierarchies and edge cases were easily caught and reviewed. External tools
			were used for visual regression testing to check that the 'bottom-margin'
			that was added to the 'Label' component didn't inadvertently break the
			'Text Input' component.

		<h5>
			Viewing software developers as the end-users of the design system gave us
			insight into what was needed for it to be useful during application
			development. Onboarding team members turned out to be easier than I
			anticipated. The software engineers who were early adopters became the
			biggest evangelists of the system. I would often hear developers calling
			over their coworkers to show them what the design system could do for
			them. They would use phrases such as, "...super, easy..." and "That's it,
			that's all you need to do."

		<h3>What I Learned</h3>
		<h5 style="page-break-after: always">
			Building a design system takes a lot of work and requires a great deal of
			up-front planning. However, the simple fact that all component code lives
			in a single location makes this approach to UI development infinitely more
			scalable and maintainable. Constant collaboration with development teams
			not only helps improve overall quality and consistency but also creates a
			sense of ownership of the system for those outside the design team.
		</h5>
		<h5 style="padding-top: var(--space-xxl)">
			Along with the practice of UX Design, the need for Design Systems
			represents an increased focus on organizational DesignOps. The need for
			designers and developers to think strategically is apparent. Applying the
			same user-centered approach to the design of systems and processes that we
			employ on our customer's experiences will allow design to scale along with
			the goals of the product organization.
		</h5>
		<h5>
			Having all presentational components flow from a single source is
			empowering with respect to their reusability across products. It is
			possible to achieve a high level of flexibility through composition and
			enhance UI exponentially by introducing new variants to existing elements.
			A good design system relies on good architecture with each part of the
			system serving a defined purpose. Understanding how each component serves
			its purpose and enhances the functions of other parts of the system allows
			a design system to scale over time while reducing the cost of maintenance
			of the source.
		</h5>
		<h5>
			The experience of building a design system and thinking about DesignOps
			has me considering the value of creating a system of UX knowledge in a
			similar manner. As we accumulate knowledge related to our users and their
			needs, it would seem prudent to find a way to manage the accumulation of
			this knowledge so that it can be revised and repurposed. Over time, many
			of our products will eventually have more in common than not. It would be
			beneficial to plan for success by building on what we've learned and
			making a practice of sharing that knowledge throughout the organization.
