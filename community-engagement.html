		<h3>What I Learned</h3>
		<h5>
			This project was the company's first mobile application and everyone was
			learning as they went. The product had been envisioned as separate app per
			city with specific branding and features based on the city's needs. As
			such, a level of customization was to be expected. However, I found that
			building applications in pixels required a lot of time and maintenance.
			The amount of assets generated for both prototyping and production took
			away from time that could have been spent on design iterations and
			testing.</h5
		>
		<h5>
			As we'd chosen to build a web application rather than a native app, I
			decided to leverage my experience designing for the browser and move to a
			coded UI on future projects.</h5
