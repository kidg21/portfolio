				The company's flagship product was an established SaaS application that
				had existed on the desktop for many years.

				This project was initiated to leverage mobile technology to provide
				users with access to their data while in the field and allow them to
				capture and sync their own data (notes, photos, etc.) for use within the
				desktop product.

			The project began life in 2013 as 'The Broker App' before being put on
			hold and picked up again for a 2017 release. The initial concept was to
			create a product that would serve as a spatially-aware CRM (customer
			relationship management) tool, allowing brokers to associate locations
			with their contacts and add insights during site visits.

			I sketched some screens on the back of index cards to account for the
			primary data elements (locations, contacts), the container that linked
			them (project), and the child elements that would belong to each (notes).
			The index cards were photographed and added to a Marvel prototype for
			review.

			After review, the decision was made to simplify things by removing the
			concept of 'Project'. The application become more property-focused with
			the intent to allow the user to create/import lists of properties and
			contacts, define associations between them, and add notes and media.

			Also, around this time, I had began work on Digital Map Products' initial
			UI Library. Typography, Color Palettes, and Iconography were being
			defined. I started working with SASS to create modular CSS that could be
			more easily maintained than image assets. Google's Material had just been
			released and card-based interfaces were becoming popular. The 2nd
			iteration was created using HTML and the new CSS.

			After incorporating feedback received on the second iteration from
			engineering and from existing LandVision customers, development began. The
			completed product was released to select customers to gather feedback on
			performance and usability. Ultimately, all follow-up work was placed on
			hold until 2017. By then, the UI library had evolved and been tested in
			production with other projects. The goal and design of the product were
			largely unchanged save for additional functionality around managing and
			syncing the user's data.

			I worked on the 1.0.0 release with a team comprised of a lead developer
			and product manager to develop the production templates below. PhoneGap
			was used to access native features on both iOS and Android releases. For
			debugging of presentational elements, I used Chrome's Inspector, XCode,
			and Ghostlab.

		<h3>What I Learned</h3>
		<h5>
			As this project was completed over 2 phases that spanned multiple years, I
			was able to gain some perspective regarding tooling and process.
		</h5>
		<h5>
			Having the presence of a product manager helped the second phase progress
			more efficiently as there was a better understanding of the user stories
			being addressed and better control over project scope. This project
			prompted me to move to code for complex prototyping where adaptive layout
			and state management can be more easily achieved. For a standalone project
			of this scope, compiling CSS from SASS partials was an effective choice as
			the scale of the application wasn't going to change significantly over
			time.
		</h5>
		<h5>
			The biggest challenge with a 'companion' app such as this is the shared
			back-end API of its desktop counterpart. Compromises to the design were
			made to mitigate the performance issues that resulted from the real-time
			sync of large datasets, which was frustrating, but also served as
			justification for future re-architecture.
