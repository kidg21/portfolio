			<h3>What I Learned</h3>
			<h5>
				This project was the company's first mobile application and everyone was
				learning as they went. The product had been envisioned as separate app
				per city with specific branding and features based on the city's needs.
				As such, a level of customization was to be expected. However, I found
				that building applications in pixels required a lot of time and
				maintenance. The amount of assets generated for both prototyping and
				production took away from time that could have been spent on design
				iterations and testing.</h5
			>
			<h5>
				As we'd chosen to build a web application rather than a native app, I
				decided to leverage my experience designing for the browser and move to
				a coded UI on future projects.</h5
