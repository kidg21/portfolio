				FLAN started in February of 2018 as a front-end platform for the next
				generation of Digital Map Products' application suite. We altered course
				during the summer of 2018 when DMP was acquired by LightBox and the
				focus shifted to creating a design system that could be used across the
				entire organization.

				FLAN includes application theming capabilities, responsive flex layout,
				and accessibily designed components. Based off the principles of atomic
				design, FLAN provides the basic building blocks of a User Interface. Our
				Component System is organized into atoms, blocks, elements, layouts, and
				templates. Additionally this system showcases our Design Guidelines,
				Colors, and Icon Library.
