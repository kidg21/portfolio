		<h2>Logistics</h2>
		<h5>
			The more time you spend as a product designer working across different
			industries, the more you realize that the problems you are solving are
			often very similar. Each solution may result in various looks and use
			different terms for the same old things, but the underlying issues that
			we're working to solve are often very similar.
		</h5>
		<h5>
			That's not to say that every industry isn't special in its own way.
			However, the key to success in designing products or services is being
			able to recognize common patterns across industries that lurk under the
			veneer.

				My logistics work began with a client request for an alternative to
				managing their business through a set of independent systems. Their data
				was scattered and required manually moving business records between
				tools. These manual processes resulted in discrepancies in their records
				and eroded trust with the clients that the business served.
				Decentralized and unstructured records prevented insight into business
				performance, making maintaining their required metrics a challenge.
			</h6>

				I contributed to this project by gathering requirements, diagramming
				primary workflows, crafting user stories, creating interactive
				prototypes, and developing a front-end design systemâ€”using Angular for
				web modules and Flutter for mobile modules.

		<h3>What The Heck Is 'Reverse' Logistics?</h3>
		<h5>
			While still hard at work on our healthcare platform, our team had the
			opportunity to design a warehouse management system for a client that
			provided reverse logistics services for a large retailer. The client was
			struggling with their existing, ad-hoc inventory management process. Their
			inefficiency was causing the retailer to question the accuracy of invoices
			often resulting in delayed payments.

		</div>
		<h5>
			The project kicked off with a weekend of on-site requirements gathering
			where the team talked with staff members to learn what challenges they
			faced and how we could help make their jobs easier. We observed their
			daily operations for managing their warehouse and trailer inventories, and
			the client walked us through the multiple systems they employed to collect
			and share data.
		</h5>
		<h5>
			After talking with the team, we found several problems with their daily
			work. They had trouble keeping track of what was in inventory, what was on
			each trailer, and making sure their different computer systems showed the
			same information. Once we understood these issues, we concluded that a
			more integrated approach to inventory management was needed. We decided to
			apply our healthcare platform's principles toward resource management to
			create a more cohesive solution for their logistics operations.
		</h5>
		<h5 style="page-break-after: always">
			Over the next few months, we worked with the client to build a simpler
			system that solved their main problems. We created one central place to
			track their inventory in real-time, and made it easy for workers to log
			and update the contents of inbound and outbound trailers. A reliable
			dataset resulted in bills of lading that were accurate, restoring the
			client's trust in the final invoice.

		<h3>Reimagining The Logistics Process</h3>
		<h5>
			In early 2025, our team partnered with supply chain veterans to further
			enhance our understanding of logistics operations. By collaborating with
			experts in the field, we aimed to identify best practices and innovative
			solutions that could be applied to challenges across the industry. During
			this phase my role centered around insisting that we think through every
			aspect of a supply chain and identify opportunities for improvement. These
			breakdowns were key in creating user stories that served as a North Star
			for all proposed designs, implementation, and evaluation.
		</h5>
		<h5>
			Managing warehouse operations is just one part of the logistics process.
			Viewing supply chain operations from a single point of view quickly
			revealed gaps related to understanding processes that warehouse personnel
			depended on to function. By looking at the entire supply chain, we began
			to think about ways to improve efficiency across all areas of the
			operation. Our WMS product underwent a rebrand and prepared for a growing
			set of siblings.

			Dwell time is a critical metric for optimizing logistics operations, as it
			directly impacts resource utilization, overall efficiency, and business
			costs. By bringing the entire logistics process onto a unified platform,
			we were able to collect relevant data on trailers, drivers, and
			transported goods. Understanding how long resources spend sitting on the
			yard or in the warehouse allows us to surface assets that have exceeded
			dwell thresholds or soon will be.

			We broke down supply chain operations into a set of modules that, in
			addition to warehouse processes, would manage a business's yards, transit,
			fulfillment, and overall business performance. These modules were
			developed independently and designed compositionally to meet the specific
			needs and scope of our clients' logistics processes. Leaning into my
			background designing mapping solutions, our first new module was a yard
			management system that leveraged geospatial data to optimize trailer
			operations and improve overall efficiency.

		<h3>What I Learned</h3>
		<h5>
			Moving goods from place to place involves many steps that all need to work
			together smoothly. I learned that each part of the process, whether it's
			storing items or shipping them, needs to cleanly inform the other aspects
			of the business to understand the big picture.
		</h5>
		<h5>
			Including dedicated research and documentation phases benefitted the
			entire team's understanding of who our product was for and what we were
			focused on solving. Defining user stories at the start gives you targets
			to evaluate against. This persists through the design, development,
			testing, and positioning of the final product.
		</h5>
		<h5>
			Overall, the challenges in the logistics space feel familiar to the
			challenges that I've encountered in other industries, including healthcare
			and real estate. I find that the common challenge for many businesses is
			adopting an effective method for managing their resources. Whether working
			with trailers and their cargos or caregivers and their patients, similar
			workflows and patterns apply. This is an understanding that I have gained
			through experience which helps me recognize the needs of businesses and
			their clients independent of industry semantics or marketing buzzwords.
