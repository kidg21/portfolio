		<h2>Visual Design</h2>
		<h5>
			Although my recent work has been focused on application design and
			development, I had to arrive there from somewhere. I entered the design
			field as a visual designer and animator. Over time, I found that
			incorporating a developer's mindset and adding technical skills allowed me
			to more effectively communicate my designs to stakeholders and present
			solutions that were feasible and realistic.

		<h5>
			I'm including some examples of figure drawing as a callback to the days
			before I became consumed by technology when I dreamed of working as an
			animator for Walt Disney. These drawings represent a foundational skill
			set that informs my design process.

			During my time at

				Arbonne
			</a>
			, a health and beauty company, I was involved in a site redesign.
			Previously, my eCommerce work was focused primarily on visual prototyping
			leaving the development of the site to software engineers. I took this
			opportunity to leverage Zurb's Foundation framework to create the
			redesigned page templates in code. Low fidelity prototypes were created
			first in order to review site architecture and interactions. The final
			designs were built upon the initial prototypes in order to maximize the
			re-use of existing code.

			In addition to earning a Fine Arts degree, I took coursework in
			traditional animation hoping to become the next Glen Keane. I may not be
			Mr. Keane, but I did learn techniques that gave me a foundation in
			animation composition and timing. Upon entering the world of digital
			animation, my tools of choice became After Effects and 3D Studio Max.

				You can tell this is a 'classic' based on the technical specs of the
				Hitachi laptop. However, this is a good example of an animation project
				that went according to plan. I worked with a composer to create the
				soundtrack, added custom illustration, and animated a lively 3D model of
				a laptop. External elements were rendered to image sequences, then
				composited and synced in After Effects. Tools used: After Effects,
				Photoshop, and 3D Studio Max.
