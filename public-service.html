			FieldForce is a mobile app that helps field technicians service local
			communities by tracking and recording their daily tasks. Initially
			designed for vector control agencies, it enables efficient management of
			mosquito inspection and treatment activities.

				The initial application of FieldForce was designed to assist Mosquito
				and Vector agencies to control the spread of disease by efficiently
				assigning technicians to inspect mosquito breeding sites and, if
				necessary, apply treatment and schedule follow-up visits.
			</h6>
			<h6>
				The application records treatment locations, treatment type, and amount.
				Workflows, such as spray routes, could be configured for auto-logging
				and recorded without the end user needing to stop and fill out a series
				of forms. Voice and Bluetooth button inputs are also supported.

			We began this project with a disovery phase where user interviews were
			conducted. I, along with 2 lead developers spent a week on-site with
			Orange County Vector Control (CA) observing their work habits and
			documenting common workflows and persistent pain points. My time was spent
			in the front office fielding community requests for services, riding
			shotgun on a sprayroute treating mosquito breeding sites, and collecting
			samples of mosquito larvae from catch basins to send to the lab for
			analysis. I also spent time speaking with administrators about their need
			for improvements in managing workflows within their departments.

			From my research, I developed the personas that would be served by the
			application. I then created sets of user stories for each persona that
			would be used to design and test against.

			During the development of this project, I was also working full-time on
			the UI Library that I'd begun while working on LandVision Connect. Due to
			the larger scale and scope of FieldForce, it became a good project with
			which to test out my approach to UI architecture.

			Final template reference was built in HTML/CSS and re-created using React

			templates and elements, making updates to the source files as needed to

		<h3>What I Learned</h3>
		<h5>
			Including a dedicated research phase benefitted the entire team's
			understanding of who our product was for and what we were focused on
			solving. Defining user stories at the start gives you targets to evaluate
			against. This persists through the design, development, testing, and
			positioning of the final product.
		</h5>
		<h5>
			When prototypes and production UI live primarily in code, it can be much
			simpler to maintain quality and consistency with minimal dependency on
			engineering.
		</h5>
		<h5>
			That said, on a larger project such as this, it became apparent that
			separate HTML, CSS, and JS would quickly get out of sync. The lack of a
			formal review process on presentational components during the development
			process also didn't help matters. Understanding this, I began to explore
			new templating libraries with the intent of creating a true design system
			that would allow for maintenance at a component's source rather than at
			its multiple outputs.
